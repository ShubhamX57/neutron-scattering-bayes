# qens - Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering analysis
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/qens/badge/?version=latest)](https://qens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
[![Python: 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

End to end Python toolbox for analysing **Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering**
data from ISIS Mantid `.nxspe` files (IRIS, OSIRIS, LET, MARI, MAPS, …) and
any other Mantid-produced inelastic-spectrometer output.

The library is built around a clean separation between **physics models**
and **inference machinery**:

* The model catalogue includes Lorentzian and Gaussian primitives, three
  translational-diffusion HWHM models (Fickian, Chudley-Elliott,
  Singwi-Sjölander), and rotational structure factors (isotropic and
  anisotropic axial rotor, expanded to *l* = 2).
* These are combined into a full forward model
  S(Q, ω) = e<sup>−Q²⟨u²⟩/3</sup> · [translation x rotation] x resolution
  with a measured-kernel resolution path (use the frozen-sample
  S(Q, ω) directly : Lorentzian wings of real instruments don't fit a
  Gaussian).
* Inference is a joint-Q likelihood across **all** Q-bins simultaneously,
  with NNLS amplitude fitting per bin. MAP search is multi-start
  Nelder-Mead; MCMC is `emcee` (with a pure-NumPy Metropolis-Hastings
  fallback). Convergence diagnostics (autocorrelation time, Gelman-Rubin
  R̂) are reported automatically.
* Custom forward models can be registered without modifying core code.

> Inline documentation lives in the code itself: every public function, class,

###  Package Installation

The `qens` package is not yet published on PyPI. Install directly from this repository:

```bash
# Clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamX57/QENS.git
cd QENS
pip install -e .

# Or install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/ShubhamX57/QENS.git
```

Then use normally:
```python
import qens
```

> **Note**: The name `qens` was already taken on PyPI. We are working on publishing as **`uqens`** (Unified Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering analysis) soon.

## Notebook

If looking for a simple method of analysis of qens data, the [notebook_app](https://github.com/ShubhamX57/QENS/blob/main/Notebook_app.ipynb) is a highly versatile quick method of performing model pre-processing, fitting and analysis. 

Simply:
- select the correct data folder and pick the correct dataset(s) to analyse
- choose appropriate physical model(built in or self written)
- Select least squares or Bayesian fitting method
- investigate parameter values and plots

the anisotropic-rotor model is used) the underlying paper:

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. See `tests/` for the existing unit tests
(`pytest -v` to run). Style: `ruff check qens`. New physical models
should land in `qens/models/` and be registered in
`qens/models/registry.py`.
